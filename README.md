# Text-Editor
Fully functional text editor made in C++

## The Project:
This was my final academic project for my intro to C++ class. My
professor, Alex Thornton, gave us about a third of the modules. It
was my job to understand what he had written already, inherit
from whatever classes I needed to, and build new code to create the
full text editor. It still took an incredible amount of hours to work
perfectly, and with no memory leaks, but I'm extremely happy with how
it turned out. I left some of the comments that professor Thornton wrote
so it would help tie a few of these files together and
even give him a bit of credit for the code he wrote himself.

## This is a C++ Based text editor that supports the following commands/interations:
  * Normal typing (Type any key and it'll appear on the text editor)
  * Move cursor right (Ctrl + L)
  * Move cursor left (Ctrl + J)
  * Move cursor up (Ctrl + I)
  * Move cursor down (Ctrl + K)
  * Backspace (Ctrl + O)
  * Create new line (Ctrl + N)
  * Delete line (Ctrl + B)
  * Cursor Home (Ctrl + H)
  * Cursor End (Ctrl + U)
  * Undo (Ctrl + Z)
  * Redo (Ctrl + Y)
  * Quit (Ctrl + Q)
  
## What I would implement in the future:
I would like to take on the challenge of implementing, cut, copy, and paste. These commands would be challenging on their own to implement, but I would also have to consider how to implement them with redo and undo working properly.

### Note:
The tarball file that I included contains the same 
three folders I included here: app, exp, and gtest.
